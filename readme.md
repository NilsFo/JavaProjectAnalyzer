# Java-Project Analyzer

An old *Java* based application, bult during my early years of Java development.
Archived via GitHub and retrace my roots.

# How to use

Run it and select a project root directory.
It will scan all sourcecode files and display some code statistics.

# Good old times

Developed some time in 2015.
Wow, I'm old.
